A version string consists of a semantic version number or version label
("lts" or "latest"), optionally preceeded by a remote name, optionally
followed by an architecture, separated by slashes.
Examples: "lts", "4.6.0", "6.3.1/x86", "node/6.7.0/x64"
Aliases may also be used anywhere in place of a version string.
