## 🎯 Project Goal
MedPlat is an **AI-driven medical case simulator** and **gamified learning platform**  
for clinicians and students.  
It generates realistic cases, interactive MCQs, and adaptive explanations  
based on expert-panel reasoning.

Important: MedPlat is a dynamic AI case generator — the system does not ship or rely on a library of static cases stored in the database. Instead, the backend generates cases on-demand from the set of clinical "topics" (see Data model below).

## 🧩 Core Objectives
| Area | Objective |
|------|------------|
| 🧠 **AI Case Generation** | Use expert-panel reasoning to build base cases. |
| 🎮 **Gamification** | Generate 12 adaptive MCQs per case with delayed expert explanations. |
| 🌍 **Localization** | Dynamic multilingual output via backend AI (no translation files). |
| 🔐 **Secure Infrastructure** | Use GitHub Secrets + Artifact Registry + Cloud Run. |
| 🧪 **Local-First Testing** | All code must pass local validation before deployment. |
| ☁️ **CI/CD Integration** | Automated secret validation → test → deploy → verify. |

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Backend
- **Node 18 / Express**
- Routes:
  - `/api/topics` → fetch topics from Firebase (`topics2`)
  - `/api/dialog` → AI conversation (GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini)
  - `/api/gamify` → generate MCQs + scoring + expert panel reasoning
  - `/api/comment` → feedback
- Utilities:
  - `generate_case_clinical.mjs`
  - `translate_util.mjs` (optional internal use)
- Integration:
  - Firebase Admin SDK (topics & logging)
  - OpenAI API (case generation + MCQs)
- Deployment: Cloud Run container (`process.env.PORT || 8080`)

### Data model

- Firebase contains a single operational dataset used by MedPlat: a `topics` collection (named `topics2` in production) that lists clinical topics or seeds (topic id, display name, optional metadata).
- The platform does NOT store static case documents or answer keys in Firestore. All cases and MCQs are generated dynamically by the AI at request time using the topic as the seed. This keeps the database small, avoids shipping PHI or copyrighted content, and ensures cases are adaptive and up-to-date.

Note: For local development the backend includes safe, non-throwing fallbacks when secrets or SDKs are missing:
- `backend/firebaseClient.js` returns a noop `firestore()` client when `FIREBASE_SERVICE_KEY` or `firebase-admin` is not available.
- `backend/openaiClient.js` provides a stubbed client when `OPENAI_API_KEY` or the OpenAI SDK is not present.
These fallbacks keep local tests and the review scripts runnable without requiring production secrets.

### Frontend
- **React (Vite + Tailwind)**
- Components:
  - `CaseView.jsx` → topic selector, model selector, gamification toggle
  - `Level2CaseLogic.jsx` → full gamified MCQ logic & scoring
  - `DialogChat.jsx` → AI chat dialog
  - `CaseList.jsx`, `CaseSelectors.jsx`, etc.
- Uses dynamic props:
  - `model` (`gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`)
  - `lang` (ISO language)
  - `gamify` (true / false)

## 🔐 Secret Management

### Repository Secrets (GitHub → Settings → Actions)
| Secret | Purpose |
|---------|----------|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Access to GPT models |
| `GCP_PROJECT` | Cloud project ID |
| `GCP_SA_KEY` | Service account JSON for Cloud Run deploy |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_KEY` | Firebase Admin SDK credentials |
| `VITE_API_BASE` | Backend URL for frontend build |

> 🧩 **No `.env` files are used in production.**  
> Development keys reside in `.env.local` (ignored by git).
