# Audit: workflow run 18938886174 artifacts

Date: 2025-10-30
Run: 18938886174

Summary:
- I inspected artifacts attached to the workflow run and downloaded the artifact named `frontend-dist`.
- I listed the files inside the artifact. The artifact contains the built frontend (`index.html`, `assets/*.js`, `assets/*.css`) and `VITE_API_BASE.txt`.
- No image files or screenshots (png, jpg, jpeg, svg, gif) were found inside the artifact or elsewhere in the repository.

Action taken:
- No deletions performed: there were no screenshot/image artifacts to remove from this run.

If you intended to remove screenshots that exist elsewhere (other workflow runs or a different repo path), tell me the run id(s) or file paths and I will delete them and create a PR that removes or documents the removal.
